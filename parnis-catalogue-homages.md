Parnis Watch Models Table
| Parnis Model | Homage? | Homage of | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| PA6050       | Yes     | Rolex – Vintage Submariner (no crown guards), similar to Tudor Black Bay 58 | No crown guards and “Mercedes” hands mimic a late-50s Submariner style (Tudor BB58 Harrods edition in green). |
| P01          | No      | (Original design) | Modern 41mm sport watch design – no clear one-to-one luxury counterpart (generic Parnis style). |
| P02          | Yes     | Nomos – Tangente (Bauhaus) | Minimalist Bauhaus dial with small seconds, clearly Nomos-inspired. A lower-cost automatic Bauhaus dress watch. |
| P03          | No      | (Unclear) | Not tied to a known model – possibly a generic dress watch or variant (no definitive homage identified). |
| P06          | Yes     | Panerai – Luminor Marina | 44mm “Marina Militare” style case with Panerai Luminor dial/guard. Parnis uses the Marina Militare moniker for Panerai homages. |
| P07          | Yes     | Bell & Ross – BR 01 series | Square 40mm “instrument” case with a visible balance (“hollow flywheel”) mimics the iconic Bell & Ross BR-01 aviation watch. |
| P09          | Yes     | Rolex – GMT-Master II | Vintage-style GMT diver (often PVD) with 24h hand. Parnis “GMT Batman” is explicitly an homage to the Rolex GMT Master II BLNR. |
| P10          | Yes     | Panerai – Luminor Submersible | Diver variant of Panerai homage. 42–44mm case with rotating bezel and rubber strap evokes Panerai Submersible models (vintage lume accents). |
| P11          | Yes     | Panerai – Radiomir | Cushion-case “Marina Militare” with wire lugs. Classic Panerai Radiomir styling (some variants with California dial). |
| B01          | Yes     | Flieger Pilot – B-Uhr Type A | 44mm pilot watch with luminous numerals and triangle at 12:00, patterned after WWII Luftwaffe pilot watches (IWC/Laco). |
| B02          | Yes     | Flieger Pilot – B-Uhr Type B | Pilot dial with outer minute markers (Type B). Homage to the same WWII German Beobachtungsuhr style, alternate dial format. |
| B03          | Yes     | Flieger Pilot (Variant) | Likely another pilot variant (e.g. sterile dial or different finish). Maintains the Big Pilot aesthetic (large size, luminous dial) akin to IWC pilot watches. |
| PA6088       | Yes     | Rolex – Datejust (Classic) | Two-tone case and gold dial pay homage to the classic Rolex Datejust. Size ~39.5mm, sapphire crystal – a dressy Rolex look-alike. |
| PA6062       | Yes     | Rolex – Sky-Dweller (Annual Calendar) | Complicated dial with day, date, month, 24-hour subdials (Miyota 9100 movement) emulates an annual calendar Rolex Sky-Dweller-type display. |
| PA7001       | No      | (Original “military” design) | Oversized 47mm men’s “military” watch. Not a specific model homage – a generic pilot/diver hybrid style by Parnis. |
| PA7002       | No      | (Original “military” design) | Same as PA7001 family – large, luminous military-styled watch, not directly copying a single luxury model. |
| PA7003       | No      | (Original “military” design) | See PA7001/7002 – no one-to-one luxury counterpart, a Parnis original in the military/tool watch genre. |
| PA7005       | No      | (Original “military” design) | Part of the PA700x series of big watches. No direct homage; generic design cues (e.g. broad dial, big crown) rather than a specific model. |
| PA7006       | No      | (Original “military” design) | Same family as above – not an homage to a famous watch, but Parnis’s own take on a large military watch concept. |
| PA8061       | Yes     | Hublot – Big Bang | Bold 45mm sporty case with Hublot-style bezel screws. Marketed as a “Big Bang” homage by Parnis. Captures the look of the Hublot Big Bang (chronograph styling sans brand). |
| PA2123       | Yes     | Nomos – Tangente (Bauhaus) | Minimalist Bauhaus dress watch, white dial w/ small seconds. Highly Nomos-inspired design (41mm automatic Bauhaus model). |
| PA2113       | Yes     | Nomos – Tangente (Bauhaus) | Another Bauhaus model (likely a variant/size of PA2123). Same Nomos-like minimalist aesthetic (sometimes black dial version). |
| PA6006       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Automatic 7-Day | 42–43mm dress watch with power-reserve indicator and small seconds mimicking the IWC Portugieser 7-Day. |
| PA6007       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Automatic 7-Day | Variation of the Portuguese homage (dial/case variant). Same Seagull ST25 movement with 40+hr power reserve, emulating IWC’s layout. |
| PA6012       | No      | (Generic dress watch) | Steel case on leather – no distinctive luxury model features. Appears to be a general Parnis dress watch (possibly inspired by many but no specific one). |
| PA6022       | No      | (Generic dress watch) | 39mm automatic on strap. No clear homage target – a simple “top brand style” dress piece (not directly a famous model). |
| PA6024       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | Clean dial chrono style (if automatic, likely a homage to the Portugieser Chronograph). Blue hands/markers suggest IWC design lineage. (Likely using a Seagull/Shanghai movement to mimic IWC Chrono). |
| PA6027       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | Variant (black or different dial) of the Portuguese Chronograph homage. Continues the IWC look (bicompax dial, 40mm+ size). |
| PA767        | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Automatic 7-Day | Earlier code for the Portuguese power-reserve model. 43mm with 40h power reserve dial – a direct homage to the IWC Portugieser Automatic. |
| PA6028       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | Another dial variant of the Portugieser Chrono homage (likely white dial). Same proportions and design cues as the iconic IWC chronograph. |
| PA6029       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | Another in the series of Portugieser-style chronographs by Parnis, differing in cosmetic details (homage remains the IWC design). |
| PA6031       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | See above – part of the family of IWC Portuguese Chrono homages. (Multiple dial/color variants share the same homage target). |
| PA6095       | Yes     | Rolex – Sea-Dweller Deepsea | 43–44mm diver with 20ATM rating. Homage to the Rolex Sea-Dweller (larger case and depth rating than Submariner). Parnis offers similar specs in this model. |
| PA6032       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | Continuation of the IWC chronograph homage line (likely another colorway or minor design tweak). |
| PA6094       | Yes     | Rolex – Sea-Dweller Deepsea | Variant of the Deepsea homage (possibly different bezel or dial color). Maintains the Rolex Deepsea design elements (helium valve, chunky case). |
| PA6033       | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Chronograph | Yet another Portugieser Chrono variant from Parnis. Same homage target (IWC) with minimal differences. |
| PA6086       | Yes     | IWC – Pilot Power Reserve (Big Pilot) | 42mm “Commander” watch with power reserve and date, similar to an IWC Big Pilot style (though Big Pilot is 46mm, this is a downsized homage with PR indicator). |
| PA6035       | Yes     | Panerai – Luminor 1950 47mm (“Fiddy”) | Large 45–47mm case, vintage Panerai styling. Likely inspired by Panerai PAM 127 “Fiddy” (Marina Militare vintage design). |
| PA6038       | No      | (Generic dress watch) | Smaller 38mm automatic watch (possibly a casual dress style). Not an obvious homage – a simple design for everyday wear. |
| PA6047       | Yes     | Panerai – Luminor 1950 47mm | 47mm case Panerai homage (matches the “1950” case shape). Clearly in tribute to Panerai’s historic 47mm models (e.g. PAM372). |
| H2102        | Yes     | Panerai – Radiomir California | 47mm hand-wind “California Dial” (mixed Roman/Arabic) – a known Panerai Radiomir design. Homage likely given the dial style and ‘H’ (handwind) prefix. |
| PA6051       | No      | (Skeleton design) | 44mm skeletonized watch. A mix of styles (pilot and open-heart) but not copying a specific luxury model – essentially an original Parnis skeleton piece. |
| PA6052       | No      | (Skeleton design) | Similar to PA6051 – Parnis skeleton/mechanical art watch. No direct homage (blends generic skeleton elements). |
| PA6054       | Yes     | Rolex – Submariner Date | Modern Submariner homage (black dial/black bezel, with date cyclops). 40mm diver with crown guards replicating the Rolex Sub Date look. |
| PA6055       | Yes     | Rolex – Submariner “Hulk” | Green dial/bezel variant homage to the Rolex Submariner 116610LV (“Hulk”). Same design as Sub Date but in Rolex’s green livery. |
| PA6056       | Yes     | Rolex – Submariner “Two-Tone” | Two-tone (gold/steel) Submariner style. Homage to models like Rolex Submariner 16613 (blue dial/bezel, gold accents). |
| PA6057       | Yes     | Rolex – Submariner No-Date | All-black Submariner no-date homage. Classic 40mm dive watch without date, mirroring the Rolex 114060 design (sterile dial, clean symmetry). |
| PA6063       | Yes     | Omega – Seamaster Diver 300M | 42mm diver with skeleton hands and wave-pattern hints. Parnis has added its own touch but clearly inspired by the Omega Seamaster 300M Bond watch. |
| PA6067       | Yes     | Rolex – Milgauss | Smooth bezel, 40mm case with colored seconds hand. Likely homage to the Rolex Milgauss (Parnis has a model with green-tint crystal and lightning seconds hand similar to Milgauss). |
| PA6068       | Yes     | Rolex – Explorer II 216570 | 42mm case with fixed 24h bezel and GMT hand. Likely mimics the Rolex Explorer II (white dial “Polar” variant often seen from Parnis). |
| PA6099       | Yes     | Rolex – Yacht-Master II | Bold 44mm case with Regatta timer look. Parnis’s design echoes the Rolex Yacht-Master II (though as a non-chronograph automatic). Blue accents and bezel style match the YMII aesthetic. |
| PA6098       | Yes     | Rolex – Yacht-Master II | Variant of the Yacht-Master II homage (possibly rose-gold bezel version). Keeps the distinctive countdown bezel and dial layout of the Rolex original. |
| PA6077       | Yes     | Omega – Seamaster Planet Ocean | ~45mm large dive watch, orange accents or bezel variant. Homages the Omega Planet Ocean line (Parnis offers similar size and design cues). |
| PA6092       | Yes     | Rolex – Daytona (Modern) | 40mm sport chronograph style (auto chrono). Likely homage to modern Rolex Daytona models – though Parnis’s Daytona homages are more often in the hand-wind series (this code may be a variant with auto movement). |
| PA6097       | Yes     | Rolex – Daytona (Modern) | Similar to PA6092 – another Daytona-style chronograph homage. Steel bezel or different dial, but modeled after Rolex’s chronograph icon. |
| PA6070       | Yes     | Breitling – Superocean Heritage | Retro diver design with mesh/rubber strap. Possibly homages Breitling’s Superocean (Parnis made 42mm vintage-style divers that resemble the Heritage II). |
| PA6071       | Yes     | Breitling – Superocean Heritage | Variant (different color) of the above Superocean homage. Retains the minimal bezel markings and vintage vibe of the Breitling original. |
| PA6072       | Yes     | Breitling – Superocean Heritage Chrono | Diver chronograph style (bi-compax layout) echoing Breitling’s Heritage Chronograph. Likely uses a Seagull ST19 to mimic the look. |
| PA6073       | Yes     | Breitling – Navitimer 01 | Parnis possibly attempts a Navitimer homage here (slide-rule bezel, busy dial). If so, it’s an homage to Breitling’s Navitimer (though Parnis usually didn’t produce mechanical chrono in this auto line; could be cosmetic). |
| PA6079       | Yes     | Omega – Aqua Terra “Skyfall” | 41mm blue dial on bracelet, resembles the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra. The blue sunburst and orange accents (if any) align with Omega’s AT designs. |
| PA6080       | Yes     | Omega – Railmaster 1957 Trilogy | Simple 3-hand 40mm watch with vintage dial, likely homaging Omega’s Railmaster reissue (Parnis’s take on a no-bezel field watch). |
| PA6081       | Yes     | IWC – Mark XVIII Pilot | 40mm pilot watch with date – clean black dial, triangle at 12. Homage to IWC’s Mark series pilot watch (modern incarnation Mark XVII/XVIII). |
| PA6082       | Yes     | IWC – Big Pilot 43 (Le Petit Prince) | Blue dial pilot watch, big crown. Likely inspired by IWC’s 43mm Big Pilot “Le Petit Prince” edition (minus the PR indicator). |
| PA6083       | Yes     | Zenith – Pilot Type 20 | Oversized vintage pilot with onion crown and bold numerals. Resembles Zenith’s Pilot Type 20. Parnis likely drew from that design for this model. |
| PA6084       | Yes     | Panerai – Luminor GMT Power Reserve | Luminor case with GMT hand and power reserve subdial on the dial, similar to Panerai Luminor GMT 44mm models. |
| PA2105       | Yes     | Omega – De Ville Hour Vision | Dress watch with clear sides or exhibition elements. Possibly homaging Omega De Ville series (an elegant 41mm design). |
| PA2106       | Yes     | Glashütte Original – Senator Observer | A 42mm power-reserve dress watch with big date? Might imitate GO’s Senator series (Parnis has done similar layouts). |
| PA2110       | Yes     | Vacheron Constantin – Patrimony | Slim dress watch, 40mm, simple dial. Could be inspired by VC Patrimony Tradtionnelle given its classic design cues. |
| PA2112       | Yes     | Rolex – Datejust 36 | Two-tone 36mm with champagne dial (older code for PA6088). Clearly a homage to the classic Rolex Datejust (Parnis PA2112 was mentioned as such on forums). |
| PA2120       | Yes     | IWC – Big Pilot Power Reserve | 45mm pilot with power reserve at 3 and date. Direct homage to IWC Big Pilot 7-Day (uses a Seagull automatic with PR to mimic the 7-day dial). |
| PA2122       | Yes     | IWC – Big Pilot Power Reserve | Variant of the Big Pilot homage (perhaps different dial color – e.g. white or blue “Le Petit Prince” edition homage). Same IWC target design. |
| PA6078       | Yes     | Omega – Seamaster 300 (Vintage) | 41mm vintage diver with broad arrow hands and no date, mimicking the Omega Seamaster 300 reissue. Likely what Parnis modeled this reference on. |
| PA1061       | Yes     | Rolex – Daytona “Paul Newman” | 39mm hand-wound chronograph with vintage cream/black dial. An open homage to the iconic vintage Rolex Daytona. |
| PA1062       | Yes     | Rolex – Daytona “Paul Newman” | Variant (black dial or opposite panda) of the Paul Newman Daytona homage. Same vintage Rolex styling cues. |
| PA1063       | Yes     | Rolex – Daytona “Paul Newman” | Another color variant (e.g. white dial/black subdials) of the manual-wind Daytona homage. |
| PA1064       | Yes     | Rolex – Daytona (Vintage) | Yet another in the series of ST19-powered Daytona homages. Captures the 1960s Rolex chronograph design. |
| PA6096       | Yes     | Patek Philippe – Nautilus 5711 | Parnis’s long-awaited Nautilus homage (“Parnilus”). 40mm integrated steel bracelet, blue dial – clearly emulating the Patek 5711. Limited run model. |
| PA6093       | Yes     | Patek Philippe – Nautilus 5711 | Variant of the Nautilus homage (perhaps white dial). Same Patek Philippe Nautilus design cues (horizontal embossing, porthole case). |
| PA2107       | Yes     | Patek Philippe – Nautilus Moonphase 5712 | Possibly the moonphase/power-reserve Nautilus homage. Parnis may have included a subdial layout resembling Patek’s 5712 complication. |
| PA6085       | Yes     | Rolex – Day-Date (“President”) | 36mm gold watch with day and date windows. Homage to the Rolex Day-Date Presidential. Two-digit day wheel and style echo the classic. |
| PA6089       | Yes     | Rolex – Day-Date (“President”) | Two-tone or variant of the Day-Date homage. Similar Rolex President inspiration with minor cosmetic differences. |
| PA768        | Yes     | IWC – Portuguese Automatic 7-Day | (Same as PA767) Another ref for the 43mm Portuguese homage. Likely differing strap or dial color, but still the IWC 7-Day tribute. |
| PA856        | Yes     | Audemars Piguet – Royal Oak | 41mm octagonal bezel, tapissé dial on steel bracelet. Parnis’s homage to the AP Royal Oak design (often referenced by enthusiasts). |
| PAA050       | Yes     | Patek Philippe – Nautilus 5711 | (PAA series) Stainless Nautilus homage – likely blue dial. Parnis marketed this limited model as paying homage to the Patek Nautilus. |
