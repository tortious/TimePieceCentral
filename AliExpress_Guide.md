## 1. Quality & Movements

| Tier      | Examples                                                           | What to Expect                                        | Notes                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entry** | Seiko **NH34/35/36/38**, Miyota **8215**, Seiko **VK/VH** (quartz) | Proven reliability, easy & cheap to replace           | Perfect first mechanicals; whole movement can be swapped for < \$30 |
| **Mid**   | Chinese in‑house (Sea‑Gull ST…, Beijing, Liaoning)                 | Good finishing, unique calibres                       | Do extra research; QC varies by brand                               |
| **Upper** | Miyota **9000** series, **SW200**, **PT5000**                      | Smoother sweep, tighter tolerances, better decoration | Expect ± \$50‑100 price bump                                        |

> **Reality check:** Even robust mechanicals need service eventually. If local watchmakers are scarce, stick to NH‑powered pieces you can replace outright.

## 2. Straps & Bracelets

* AliExpress stock straps are **hit‑or‑miss**.
* Focus on the **dial, case, size, and movement** – straps are cheap to upgrade later.
* Common lug widths: **20 mm / 22 mm** → stock a few rubber, NATO, and leather options.
* Most aftermarket straps arrive with **spring‑bar tools**; swap‑outs take minutes.

## 3. Reliable Brands (alphabetical)

| Budget–Friendly | Mid‑Tier        | Higher‑Tier\*                      |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Addiesdive      | Baltany         | San Martin                         |
| Berny           | Boderry         | Sea‑Gull (original designs)        |
| Cadisen         | Corguet         | Steeldive “Titanium”, PT5000 lines |
| Pagani Design   | Escapement Time | Watchdives Ti / carbon models      |
| Tandorio        | Proxima         | IXDAO                              |
| Thorn           | Sugess          | —                                  |

\*“Higher‑Tier” on AliExpress still costs a fraction of mainstream Swiss equivalents; expect premium cases, sapphire, and upgraded movements.

**More reputable names:** Aesop • Cronos • Farasute • Heimdallr • Hroudland • Militado • Milifortic • Mysterious Code • Octopus Kraken • Reef Tiger • Seastern • Steelflier • Top Hill • Yelang

## 4. Smart Search & Buying Workflow

1. **Image Search > Word Search**

   * Upload a pic of the original (e.g., Speedmaster) → Ali returns all homages.
2. **Compare ALL variants**

   * Different brands tweak bezels, logos, specs. Pick your favourite.
3. **Check every official outlet**

   * Same watch often appears in several “Brand Global/Official Stores” at different prices.
4. **Avoid “Shop123456” traps**

   * Tiny stores may drop‑ship or offload QC rejects; shipping delays common.
5. **Options menu matters**

   * Sapphire vs. mineral, NH35 vs. PT5000, etc., hide in dropdowns—double‑check before paying.
6. **Free cancellations** (before dispatch)

   * Change your mind? Hit “Cancel” → seller approves → automatic refund.

## 6. Shipping, Duties & Tracking

* **Default:** *AliExpress Standard* (cheap, uses postal service) – 2‑4 weeks typical.
* **Upgrade:** DHL / FedEx (\~\$15‑25) – \~1 week, better tracking, lower risk.
* **Track smarter:** Paste tracking number into apps like **“Packages”** for real‑time status.
* **Customs:** Import VAT & duties vary—check your country’s rates before purchase.

---

## 7. Final Thoughts

* **Research first:** YouTube channels (e.g., *Just One More Watch*, *The Time Teller*) give hands‑on impressions.
* **Use common sense:** If every store lists a watch at \$60 and one lists it at \$15, assume fake/QC reject.
* **Ignore brand snobs:** Modern Chinese homages routinely deliver sapphire, stainless (or titanium), and solid Japanese movements for **\~25 %** of mainstream prices.

> **Bottom line:** Choose the design you love, verify the specs, buy from an official outlet, and enjoy exceptional value without the anxiety of babying a safe‑queen. Happy hunting! 🕒
