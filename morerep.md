‚ö†Ô∏è Vendors to Skip for Your Price Range
	‚Ä¢	DHGate / AliExpress ‚Äì Cheap but QC is a gamble.
	‚Ä¢	Perfect Clones / PureTime ‚Äì Sometimes creep above $700 for superclones; slow comms.
	‚Ä¢	Andiot ‚Äì Too little verifiable info to be worth it.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can map each of these vendors to specific watch factories (VSF, ZF, Clean, Noob, etc.) so you‚Äôll know exactly which dealer to hit for a given replica type.
That way you‚Äôll know who to go to for the best Daytona vs best Submariner vs best AP without guessing.

Do you want me to make that factory/vendor pairing chart next?

Here‚Äôs the consolidated summary of every replica watch dealer, marketplace, or seller you‚Äôve either directly asked about or we‚Äôve discussed across past conversations ‚Äî grouped by type for clarity.
